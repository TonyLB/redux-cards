## My Stuff

You can run this locally using npm start (if I've correctly configured my git hub so that you can download everything you need, which is always a dicey question).  It should bring up a localhost:3000 web page that will have some simple 10-card deck with X's and Y's, a litle countdown clock, and eventually a draw arrow.  You may:

* draw cards, deliberately delayed by the constant cooldown clock (later developments will let a player speed and then automate this process)
* discard cards that you don't want in your hand
* shuffle the discard and draw piles together
